# Documentation

> Fork the repository, and open the repository in a Github CodeSpace.
> Alternatively, you may also decide to clone the repo and download it to your local system.
> Using a terminal navigate to root directory of the project and execute ```go build``` followed by ```go run main.go``` to execute built file and run the server.
> If you are in codespaces, use *live server* extension from VS Code extension tab. If you are on local, running the project on localhost would satisfy the purpose.
> Once the server is running, append respective URI in the URL such as ```/form``` and  ```/hello```
