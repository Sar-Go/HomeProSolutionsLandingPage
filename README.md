1. Fork the repository, and open the repository in a Github CodeSpace.
2. Alternatively, you may also decide to clone the repo and download it to your local system.
3. Using a terminal navigate to root directory of the project and execute ```go build``` followed by ```go run main.go``` to execute built file and run the server.
4. If you are in codespaces, use *live server* extension from VS Code extension tab. If you are on local, running the project on localhost would satisfy the purpose.
5. Once the server is running, append respective URI in the URL such as ```/form``` and  ```/hello```
6. The application should be working.
